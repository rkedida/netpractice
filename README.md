## Introduction

This project provides an opportunity to understand and practice TCP/IP addressing via a series of exercises.

The project includes an interactive web interface for practicing network configuration across 10 levels,

each with a different network diagram and a set of issues to solve.

## Getting Started

First, clone the reposotory. 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rkedida/netpractice.git
```

Inside the reposotory is a .tgz file.

Extract the .tgz file.

To start the exercise interface, run the `index.html` file, which should open in your default web browser.

## Usage

After launching `index.html`, you'll be greeted with the NetPractice interface. Input your login to start practicing,

or leave the field empty to try the ’correction’ version.

For each level, a non-functioning network diagram is displayed.

You're expected to modify the unshaded fields in the diagram until the network configuration is correct.

Use the 'Check again' button to verify if your configuration is correct.

Once a level is successfully completed, an option to navigate to the next level will appear.

Use the 'Get my config' button to export your configuration for submission. It's important to export your configuration before moving on to the next level.

At the bottom of the interface, logs are displayed to help understand any issues with your configuration.
